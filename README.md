# UW Impact Content Management System
Welcome to UW Impact CMS, an initiative to support UW Impact Web Services. 

## Background
UW Impact is a student group at University of Winnipeg, that seeks to provided tech solutions to enahance students' experience at UofW. We launched a web services project back in March 2020 that provides free responsive websites to other student organizations. In December 2020 I created this web app to make the web service more accessible to the stident groups as it enables them to manage the content of their website anytime from anywhere. UW Impact CMS has also made it easier for us to deliver new websites; we can now deliver a new website within 15 minutes.

## Mission & Vision
We promote digitalization on campus and bring toegther the tech enthusiast students to help them use their skills to help the community. Tech has the power to change for better and we are here to bring that change.
